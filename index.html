          <h1>Hi! I'm Kai Hong, a full stack developer with experience in devops and security. Currently making a difference for Singapore citizens at Govtech.</h1>
          <p>
            Recently graduated from university in 2019, my journey in the tech world began when I first saw my dad take apart a <strong>Pentium II</strong> computer. It left a deep impression, which lead me to pick up HTML as my first language at 12. The goal was to modify the Blogspot layout I had then, and I have been <a href="https://blog.lordofgeeks.com/" target="_blank">blogging</a> rather consistently ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward a few years, I've taken on numerous projects to perfect my craft of creating software. One notable project in school involved creating a Custom Relationship Management System for Fooyo Pte. Ltd using PHP and Bootstrap, it won the <a href="https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/students/awards/jing-king-tech-book-prize-integrative-team-project" target="_blank">Jing King Tech book prize</a> for being the most outstanding project.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I took up freelance projects, some of which were from my university. It includes creating a <strong>code grading system</strong>, which will grade students' code submissions in a sandboxed environment as well as a <strong>Portfolio CMS</strong> for my professors. I've also developed and managed the WordPress website for <a href="https://paperspace.asia/" target="_blank">Paperspace</a>, an architecture firm.
